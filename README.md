I'm passionate about software engineering and love diving into complex challenges. Currently, Iâ€™m focused on crafting high-performance systems with Rust and exploring functional programming with Haskell at APIToolkit. Contributing to open-source projects keeps me connected to the community and fuels my growth as a developer.

When I'm not coding, youâ€™ll catch me gaming or tinkering with new tech. I thrive on collaboration and am always up for a chat about code, games, or exciting project ideas.

Feel free to check out my repositories and reach out if youâ€™d like to collaborate, discuss Rust/Haskell, or just geek out over tech and gaming!
